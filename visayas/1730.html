    <h2>WHY VISIT <br>1730 Jesuit House</h2>
    <button class="choose-btn">26 Zulueta Street, Parian District, Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines</button>
    <p>The 1730 Jesuit House, also known as Museo Parian sa Sugbo, is a significant historical landmark in Cebu City. 
        Constructed during the Spanish colonial period, it served as the residence and headquarters for Jesuit priests until their expulsion in 1768. 
        The house's architecture reflects a blend of Filipino, Chinese, and Spanish influences, evident in its coral stone walls and wooden interiors.</p>
    <p>Rediscovered in the 20th century, the house was integrated into a hardware warehouse, inadvertently preserving its structure.
        Today, it functions as a museum, offering guided tours that delve into Cebu's colonial past. 
        Exhibits include period furnishings, religious relics, and artifacts that narrate the story of the Jesuit mission and local life during the 18th century.</p>
    <p>Visitors to the 1730 Jesuit House can immerse themselves in a tangible piece of Philippine history. 
        The museum provides insights into the daily lives of its former inhabitants and the broader historical context of the era. 
        Its preservation offers a unique opportunity to connect with the cultural and architectural heritage of Cebu.</p>
