    <h2>WHY VISIT<br>MAYON VOLCANO</h2>
    <button class="choose-btn">Albay, Bicol Region, Luzon, Philippines.</button>
    <p>Mayon Volcano is one of the Philippines' most iconic natural landmarks, known for its near-perfect cone shape that captivates both locals and tourists. Towering at 2,462 meters, it stands proudly in the province of Albay, offering breathtaking views from every angle. Its symmetrical beauty has made it a favorite subject for photographs, paintings, and legends passed down through generations.</p>
    <p>Despite its elegant appearance, Mayon is an active volcano with a long history of eruptions, some of which have caused significant damage and loss of life. Its activity is closely monitored by volcanologists to ensure the safety of nearby communities. Mayon's powerful presence is a reminder of nature's dual character—both beautiful and unpredictable.    </p>
    <p>Surrounding Mayon are lush landscapes, fertile plains, and vibrant communities that thrive in its shadow. It is also part of the Mayon Volcano Natural Park, a protected area that attracts hikers, nature lovers, and researchers. The volcano not only shapes the geography of the region but also influences its culture, economy, and the resilience of its people.</p>
