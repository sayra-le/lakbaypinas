    <h2>WHY VISIT<br>INTRAMUROS</h2>
    <button class="choose-btn">Manila, National Capital Region (NCR), Luzon, Philippines.</button>
    <p>Intramuros, meaning "within the walls," is the oldest district in Manila, built by the Spanish colonizers in the late 1500s. It served as the political, religious, and educational center of the Spanish colonial government. The entire city was fortified with massive stone walls to protect against invasions and attacks.</p>
    <p>Inside Intramuros were important structures like government offices, Catholic churches, convents, and schools, including the oldest existing church, San Agustin Church. The streets were narrow and paved with cobblestones, reflecting the classic architecture and layout of a European colonial city. At the heart of it all was Fort Santiago, a key military fortress and prison.</p>
    <p>Today, Intramuros is a preserved heritage site where visitors can walk through history. Tourists can explore museums, ride traditional kalesas (horse-drawn carriages), and enjoy cultural performances. It remains a living monument to the Philippines’ rich and complex past.</p>
